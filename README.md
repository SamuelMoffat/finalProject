### Created by Samuel Moffat

## Setup
Clone Project and ensure the latest version of java is installed on machine. Open the project using IDE (IntelliJ was used during development). 

## Start
Run the main method located in the 'driver' package

To change the number of data points generated go into the 'dataGeneration' package and inside the 'DataGenerator' class go to line 31 and change value to desired. 
Note: High values can cause lag, especially on map view.
Similarly to change the random generation seed change line 20 to a desired number.

## Output
.csv files will be placed inside the 'dataPoints' package. The name of each .csv file will specify which data is inside. The unanalysed data points which have been generated
is also present.
